# Project 1: AWS Infrastructure Foundation

This project focuses on building a secure AWS foundation using core networking and security concepts.

The environment is built incrementally:
    • Phase 1: AWS console build (fundamentals)
    • Phase 2: Refactor into Terraform
    • Phase 3: Add Python automation
    • Phase 4: Add AI-supported documentation review

## Terraform Implementation (In Progress)

This infrastructure is being rebuilt as part of formal Terraform training to strengthen my understanding of state management, plan/apply workflow, and infrastructure lifecycle best practices.

The current implementation reflects foundational structure and will be refined further after completing structured Terraform coursework.
